Project 0:

The package provided here is intended to handle two scenarios based on user input:

Scenario 1: Turtle bot is expected to move user defined distance with constant velocity.

Scenario 2: Turtlebot is expected to move user defined distance start from rest, accelerating till a peak velocity, continue at peak velocity and decelerate to rest.

For this project, we have defined following values for the robot:

Max velocity = 1 m/s
Acceleration = 0.25 m/s^2

Since the robot is moving forward in single direction , in this particular case, distance and displacement is equal and the terms can be used interchangably.

After running the node,it will ask for 2 inputs: 
a) Distance to be travelled 
b) Scenario number

The velocity can be seen as logs printed by the node.
